# Python-Challenge
it's time to show what I learned all this week with Python.
This challenge is about to work which is the world of programming with Python and put away Excel.
There are two dataset; PyBank(budget_data.csv) and PyPoll(election_data.csv).
My task is to create a Python script by using PyBank and PyPoll dataset.

PYBANK
What I have done with Pybank that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
You are able to see result of PyBank in analysis folder is budget_analysis.txt 
Also to see run script, located in Pybank in analysis folder is main.py


PYPOLL
PyPoll script that analyzes by using election_data.csv the votes and calculates each of the following values:
-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received vote
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote
You are able to see result of PyPoll in analysis folder is election_analysis.txt 
Also to see run script, located in PyPoll in analysis folder is main.py
